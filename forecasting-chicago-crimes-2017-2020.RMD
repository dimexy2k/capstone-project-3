<h1><center> Forecasting Chicago Crime Numbers (2017-2021) </center></h1>
<h4><center> Based on Crime Data from 2001 to 2016 </center></h4>
<br>

<h4>What can be forecast?</h4>

<p> Forecasting is required in many situations: deciding whether to build another power generation plant in the next five years requires forecasts of future demand; scheduling staff in a call centre next week requires forecasts of call volumes; stocking an inventory requires forecasts of stock requirements. Forecasts can be required several years in advance (for the case of capital investments), or only a few minutes beforehand (for telecommunication routing). Whatever the circumstances or time horizons involved, forecasting is an important aid to effective and efficient planning. </p>

<br>

<h4> Types of Forecasting </h4>

1. Quantitative forecasting
  
  + Numerical information about the past is available
  + It is reasonable to assume that some aspects of the past patterns will continue into the future.
  
2. Cross-sectional forecasting
  + With cross-sectional data, we are wanting to predict the value of something we have not observed, using the information on the cases that we have observed. 
  
3. Time series forecasting
  + Time series data are useful when you are forecasting something that is changing over time (e.g., stock prices, sales figures, profits, etc.)

chicagocrimes20122015$Date <- as.Date(chicagocrimes20122015$Date, "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p")
by_Date <- na.omit(chicagocrimes20122015) %>% group_by(Date) %>% summarise(Total = n())
tseries <- xts(by_Date$Total, order.by=as.POSIXct(by_Date$Date))


df <- chicagocrimes20122015 %>% group_by(Date) %>% summarise(y = n()) %>% mutate(y = log(y))

names(df) <- c("ds", "y")
df$ds <- factor(df$ds)


```

### Overview of Prophet(Facebook's Forecasting R Package)

* Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data. It is based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly and weekly seasonality, plus holidays. It works best with daily periodicity data with at least one year of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data, shifts in the trend, and large outliers.

* Prophet is open source software released by Facebook's Core Data Science team.

### Fitting the model

```{r}

m <- prophet(df)

```

### Creating dataframe with historical dates and future dates to forecast

```{r}

future <- make_future_dataframe(m, periods = 365 * 4)

head(future)

tail(future)

```

### Forecasting by using predict method

```{r}

forecast <- predict(m, future)

tail(forecast[c('ds', 'yhat', 'yhat_lower', 'yhat_upper')])

```

### How to evaluate a forecasting model?

<p> Once a model has been selected and its parameters estimated, the model is used to make forecasts. The performance of the model can only be properly evaluated after the data for the forecast period have become available. A number of methods have been developed to help in assessing the accuracy of forecasts.  </p>

### Basic plotting of the forecast

```{r}

plot(m, forecast)

```


### Plotting forecast broken down into trend, weekly and yearly

```{r}

prophet_plot_components(m, forecast)

```
